# Nb3Sn-CrackNet-v2
A package to identify, separate, extract, and analyse strands, filaments, and cracks, from stitched microscopic cross-sectional images of Nb3Sn Magnet Superconducting Coils. This algorithm was developed by me in a research project for the US Department of Energy, in coordination with research scientists and engineers at CERN and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's ATAP division.
