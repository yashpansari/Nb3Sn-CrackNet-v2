# Nb3Sn-CrackNet-v2
A package to extract strands, filaments, and cracks within those filaments from stitched cross-sectional images of Nb3Sn Magnet Superconducting Coils. This algorithm was developed by me for the Department of Energy, in coordination with research scientists and engineers at CERN and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's ATAP division.
